canon_solver is a python package that allows one to find multiple
voices based off of a given theme. 

In order to make use of the package, make sure to add the parent 
directory of the canon_solver package to your python path.

For a simple example:

  python -m canon_solver.tests.row.run

will output the results of the test run on "Row Row Your Boat" into 
the current working directory.
