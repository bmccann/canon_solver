For this project, you will need to install music21.

Instructions can be found here:
http://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/installing/installMac.html

After installing music21, you can run a sample of the canon solver from the console with 'python solver/canon.py'. 

Two examples are included in these supplementary materials. By default, the canon solver is set to solver puzzle1, a variation on the King's Royal Theme. In order to change to puzzle2, simply change the method in line 78 of the run script of canon.py from puzzle1 to puzzle2.

You can also listen to the audio output from our baseline and puzzle1 in the audio directory.
